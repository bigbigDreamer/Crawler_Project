# Crawler_Project
<h1>How do you do! This is a little crawler project I did recently.</h1>
<h2>Would you like to develop it with meï¼Ÿ</h2>
<li><strong>This project is done by Express 4.x in the node. js framework.</strong><br>
<li><strong>Static pages use BootStrap3.3.7.</strong><br>
<li><strong>The front-end framework USES jQuery3.2.1.</strong><br>
<p>I adopted hotnode in NPM package to start the project, which can be refreshed 
in real time without manually starting the server.</p>
<li><i>If you are interested, then please join me!
